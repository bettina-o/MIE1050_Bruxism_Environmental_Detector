'''
- Built in tools (arduino serial monitor, serial plotter) don't have auto-save features (need to copy-paste or screenshots)
- Can't directly access arduino variables (memory) with python, must read raw serial data via pyserial from serial monitor
- for csv library docs see:https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python/writing-csv-files-in-python/
- This code turns the expected arduino output: "1.00, 38.00, 16.00, 2.00" (mic, temp, humidity, light level)
  into a csv file with timestamp: [12:34:56.789 1.00 38.00 16.00 2.00]
- Timestamp note: python script isn't pulling timestime from Arduino output because Arduino sketch doesn't send timestamps, instead 
   the script adds timestamps each time a new line of data is received and parsed
